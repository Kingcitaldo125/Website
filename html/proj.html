<img src="./ssurge.PNG" width="400" height="400" class="center">
<p class="pp">This is described by our professor as a DIY engine that we(about 20 of us total) made during the course of 2 semesters in Realtime Interactive Programming.
Features include sound, shaders, third person controllers, animation, physics and much more.</p>

<h2 class="smm">Cabin in the Woods</h2>
<img src="./cabin.PNG" width="300" height="300" class="center">
<p class="pp">This is a game project that I worked on during Computer Graphics II
at Shawnee State University. All code was written in Javascript and GLSL.
Simple game concept: walk around a map and pick up pages. Collect all of the pages to win the game.
The game idea was loosely based on the Slender: The Nine Pages game.</p>

<p class="pp">An Operating System kernel made as a final project for Operating Systems One
at Shawnee State. The video shows the capabilities of typing text into a shell, then the Kernel
will read the text back after the 'Enter' key is pressed. Made in C and Assembly languages.</p>
